\chapter{InGaAsSb/GaAs/GaP QDs for Flash memories}\label{chap:TUB_QD}

%The direct-band gap semiconductor InGaAs represents the basic of the active area of a multitude of commercial photonic devices
%Optical emitters are one of the key components of optoelectronics and photonics. Despite the considerable progress in light emitting technology in visible spectral range during the last decades, the implementation of efficient light emitters on silicon remains a challenge. 
Today's market of computer memories is divided mainly between two kinds of memories, i.~e., the dynamical random access memory (DRAM)~\citep{waser_2003} and the flash memory~\citep{Pavan_1997}. The DRAM is fast but volatile, which means that the information must be refreshed within every tens of milliseconds. On the other hand flash memory is a non-volatile memory with a storage time of more than ten years without any power consumption, however, it suffers from a slow write time of several microseconds. Semiconductor memory community is seeking for a memory based on the advantages of both previous types, which would combine the fast write/read speed with long storage time. Different approaches towards that goal are studied at the moment, such as FeRAM, MRAM or PCRAM, etc.~\citep{Burr_IBM2008}.

One of the promising options to combine fast write speed and long storage time is the use of QD-Flash~\citep{Geller_APL2008_QDFlash}, a memory based on self-organized quantum dots (QDs) fabricated from III-V materials. These nano-objects can be prepared by Stranski-Krastanov growth mode and due to a variety of methods for material band structure engineering its band-offsets and barriers can be tuned in contrast to the fixed SiO$_2$ barriers in the current Flash memories.\\
%
\indent Storage of information is always a non-equilibrium situation, which is lost after a certain time. In the QD-based memory this process is limited by certain time of thermal emission only. The storage time for various materials based on either electron~\citep{Anand_apl1995_elflash,Nowozin_2013_sum} or hole~\citep{GellerPRB, stracke_apl2012_qdflash_GaP,Nowozin_2013_sum} storages were studied. The energy levels of confined holes in a QD are much more favourably confined than those of electrons owing to their larger effective mass, therefore, at least one order of magnitude more holes can be stored in a given volume than electrons. \\
%
\indent One of the suitable systems of QD-Flash for realization of long storage time are heterostructures grown on GaP substrates. For In$_{0.25}$Ga$_{0.75}$As/GaAs/GaP the storage time of 3~$\mu$s was measured at room temperature~\citep{stracke_apl2012_qdflash_GaP}, which is insufficient for memory usage, however, it is already three orders higher than the time for a typical representative of III-V QDs from InGa/GaAs~\citep{GellerPRB}. Longer storage time can be expected in the GaSb/GaP system, due to higher localization energy. Several pioneering studies based on 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations have been reported for GaSb/GaP system where the storage time is predicted in a range of 1 to $10^5$ years~\citep{Bimberg_proceedingSPIE}, however, the experimentally observed times were not larger than 3.9~days~\citep{Bonato_pssolidi_GaSbonGaP}.\\%  Moreover, the storage time for GaSb/GaP heterostructure was predicted in a range 1 and $10^5$ years with 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations~\citep{Bimberg_proceedingSPIE}.\\
%
\indent The use of structures grown on GaP substrate has another benefit compared to other III-V semiconductors, where crystalline defects are generated during the III-V/Si heteroepitaxy. On the contrary, it was proposed to use pseudomorphic GaP/Si substrates benefiting from the low lattice mismatch between GaP and Si (0.37~\% at 300~K) to avert the formation of these defects~\citep{Beyer_jap2013,Grassman_apl2013, Lin_jcg2013}. Hence, the GaP-based heterostructures can be implemented in defect-free quality on Si chips.

In this chapter, we follow several previous experimental works which investigated {(In,Ga)As/GaP} QDs. InAs/GaP QDs have first been reported in Refs.~\citep{Leon_apl1998, guo_solidi2009}, but efficient PL was not achieved because of the plastic relaxation due to the large lattice mismatch (11.2\%). Later on, however, Futchi et al.~\citep{Fuchi_physicaE2004} measured PL up to 77~K on InGaAs/GaP QDs and pointed to the issue of In composition and dominant role of In amount was demonstrated via calculations~\citep{Fukami_solodi2011}. Rivoire et al.~\citep{Rivoire_prb2012} claimed a single dot emission of type-I In$_{0.5}$Ga$_{0.5}$As/GaP QDs and, subsequently, the structural and emission properties were studied~\cite{Stracke_apl2014, Sala_apl2016}. To initiate the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode of In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As QDs on GaP, the GaP surfaces need to be covered by thin layer of GaAs prior to In$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As deposition~\citep{stracke_apl2012_qdflash_GaP}.

We investigate a set of samples with In$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$/GaAs/GaP QDs with GaAs layer thickness of 5~ML and we focus on energies around 1.8~eV where the emission from these QDs is expected. We study PL of these samples as function of excitation power and temperature. The dynamics of optical transitions in the studied ensembles is examined by time-resolved PL (TRPL).


\section{In$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$/GaAs/GaP QD samples}
The samples were grown on GaP(001) substrate by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) in Stranski-Krastanov mode in a horizontal Aixton 200 reactor using H$_2$ as carrier gas at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin~\citep{Sala_apl2016}. \\
%
\indent The growth starts with 250~nm GaP buffer layer followed by 20~nm AlGaP barrier and 150~nm GaP at the temperature of 750~$^\circ$C. Subsequently the temperature is reduced to 500~$^\circ$C for the following steps: (i) growth of a thin GaAs interlayer (5~ML) for all studied samples, (ii) for samples which we call S$_\mathrm{with}$ and S$_\mathrm{cap}$ a short Sb-flush is applied by supplying the triethyl-antimony for two and one second, respectively, at input flux of $2.6~\mu\mathrm{mol/min}$, (iii) In$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$ QDs growth, (iv) GaSb cap in case of sample S$_\mathrm{cap}$ (v) growth interruptions (GRI) for 1~s, and finishing of the structure by GaP capping layer of 6~nm thickness. Finally, samples are heated to 620~$^\circ$C to grow 50~nm thick GaP layer. The samples are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:TUstructure} and their differences and labels are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:samples}.

We have studied the material composition of the sample S$_\mathrm{cap}$ by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) with an add-on energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector (SUPER-X EDX detector was used). These measurements were performed at the high resolution TEM FEI Titan Themis at CEITEC Brno. The TEM image of the whole sample and EDX emission spectrum are attached in appendix~\ref{chapter:appendix_TEM}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:TEM}, cross-sectional TEM micrograph and graphs from simultaneously measured EDX spectra for sample S$_\mathrm{cap}$ are presented. EDX spectrum is collected along the orange dashed line and averaged in the yellow boundary area. In the atomic fraction graph we show material composition on the sample as a function of horizontal position for all constituents (Ga, P, As, In, Sb). In the range between 30 and 40~nm in the cut the fractions of In, As and Sb composition (elements, which are expected only in QDs area) dramatically increase in comparison with the concentration of 0.8~\% seen in the remainder of the sample. In the same range, we can see a decrease in phosphorus concentration at the expense of GaP. The layer where In concentration is higher than 0.8~\% we regard as QD area and its thickness is found to be of 5.8~nm with truncated-pyramid shape QDs with a base length of about 15~nm and a height of 2.5~nm. 
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{/TEM/koncentrace_final_mapa2_QDinset}
	\caption{The atomic fraction vs. position in the vertical cut for all elements present in sample S$_\mathrm{cap}$ measured by EDX detector along the orange line in the right panel and averaged in the area circumferenced by the yellow broken curve. In QD area, i.~e., between the vertical positions of 30 and 40~nm in the cut, a substantial increase of In, As, Sb (compounds only in QD structures) and decrease of P (P is out of the QD structures) are observed. The inset shows the composition solely in the QD region. The column on right-hand side represents from top to bottom: cross-section TEM image of S$_\mathrm{cap}$ taken under strong-beam bright field condition using the (200) reflection perpendicular to the growth direction; and three EDX images measured at the same time as TEM measurements -- red one for P, white in As and purple in In.}
	\label{fig:TEM}
\end{figure}

We use the EDX data to estimate the concentration of individual elements in quaternary QD structure. Assuming that all phosphorus is bound in GaP, the concentration of Ga can be divided into Ga concentration in GaP $C_\mathrm{GaP}$ and in QD area $C_\mathrm{Ga}^\mathrm{QD}$ as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
C_\mathrm{Ga}=C_\mathrm{GaP}+C_\mathrm{Ga}^\mathrm{QD}=C_\mathrm{P}+C_\mathrm{Ga}^\mathrm{QD},
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $C_\mathrm{i}$ for $i \in \{\mathrm{Ga}, \mathrm{P}\}$ is the measured concentration of Ga and P. We assume the composition of our QDs in the form of In$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$, thus, we can calculate effective concentration in QD area as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
x=\frac{C_\mathrm{Ga}^\mathrm{QD}}{C_\mathrm{Ga}^\mathrm{QD}+C_\mathrm{In}^\mathrm{QD}},\qquad
y=\frac{C_\mathrm{As}^\mathrm{QD}}{C_\mathrm{As}^\mathrm{QD}+C_\mathrm{Sb}^\mathrm{QD}}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Given the assumption that In, Ga and Sb are only in QD area, we can replace the concentration in this region by data from EDX. Finally, we give the estimation of $x$ and $y$ which we use in 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations of $x=84-93.5~\%$ and $y=68-91.5~\%$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:concentration_estimation}.

\section{Estimation of hydrostatic strain in GaAs layer}
For estimation of a hydrostatic component of strain we have performed room temperature Raman measurements of our samples. These measurements were obtained using NT-MDT spectrometer with a 100$\times$/0.7~NA long working length objective and 532~nm laser. The scattered light was dispersed using a 1800~groove/mm grating and detected by a thermoelectrically cooled Si CCD camera. The spectra were recorded in $z(xy)z$ backscattering geometry.

Measured signals were fitted by the sum of 3 Lorentzian curves.
Let us focus on Raman signal around 290~cm$^{-1}$ where TO phonon of strained GaAs QWs for our QDs samples is expected. Fig.~\ref{fig:raman} indicates $\sim$19~cm$^{-1}$ shift of TO phonon for our QD samples compared to bulk material. Using a model given in Ref.~\cite{Montazeri_Nano2010} we can use that shift to estimate the value of hydrostatic strain $\epsilon_{xx}$ 
\begin{equation}
k_\mathrm{TO}^2 = k_\mathrm{TO,B}^2 + (p+2q)\epsilon_{xx},
\end{equation}
where $k_\mathrm{TO}$ and $k_\mathrm{TO,B}$ are the Raman shifts of TO GaAs mode of strained and bulk GaAs, and $p$ and $q$ are phonon deformation potentials taken from Ref.~\cite{Cerdeira_PRB1972}.

The measured shifts of TO mode for $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ correspond to $\epsilon_{xx}=-0.032$, for $S_\mathrm{with}$ to $\epsilon_{xx}=-0.026$,  and for $S_\mathrm{cap}$ we find $\epsilon_{xx}=-0.030$, which is in good agreement with the predicted hydrostatic strain component $\epsilon_{xx}=-0.034$ by the $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ calculations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:raman_theory_wo}. %approximately three times less than predicted hydrostatic strain component by the $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ calculations, see Fig.~\ref{fig:raman_theory_wo}.

\section{Experimental setup for photoluminescence measurements}
The PL measurements were performed using standard PL setup. The samples were positioned in the cryostat, cooled to 15~K and pumped by a laser diode with the wavelength of 405~nm and focused to 0.05~mm$^2$ large spot size. The emitted emission signal was dispersed by a 1200~grooves/mm ruled grating designed to the wavelength of 750~nm and synchronously detected by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD). We have performed the following PL experiments: (i) in intensity dependent measurements the laser power was varied by a neutral density (ND) filter over more than 4 orders of magnitude, (ii) in the temperature resolved PL temperature was changed from 15~K to room temperature, but for our samples and given integration time (0.3~s per one wavelength) we have not detected any PL signal at 300~K, (iii) the polarization of the PL was analyzed by a rotating achromatic half-wave retarder followed by a fixed linear polarizer.

In time-resolved experiments we have used laser with wavelength of 405~nm focused on 0.06~mm$^2$ area with pulse-width of 60~ps; emitted PL spectrum was dispersed again by 1200~grooves/mm ruled grating and detected by a Si APD. We have performed the following TRPL experiments: (i) intensity resolved TRPL was measured at 15~K in 200~ns temporal window with resolution around 800~ps; the pumping power density was tuned by a ND filter in a range of 0.1--0.7~W/cm$^2$. The repetition rate of the laser was 5~MHz. (ii) In temperature resolved TRPL a temperature was changed on a range 15--150~K, the temporal window was modified to maximize the resolution from 200~ns for lower temperature to 25~ns for higher temperature. Tuning the temporal window is connected with changes in repetition rate, which was varied between 5 (for the temporal window 200~ns) and 80~MHz (for 25~ns).

Both experimental setups are schematically depicted in~Fig.~\ref{fig:Madrid_setup}.

\section{Photoluminescence measurements}

The homogeneity of samples was tested by performing PL measurements on different spots of them. The results of that for each sample (distinguished by the type of the curve) and for various samples (different color) are depicted in the Fig.~\ref{fig:PL_homogenity}. We can see that samples are rather spatially homogeneous, hence our measurements might be considered as reproducible for each sample. %it is not necessary measured PL and TRPL in the same time. 

Let us look at the emission around the energy of 1.8~eV. Firstly, we compare substrate emission in this spectral range with signal from our samples. We clearly see a broader band which is approximately 70~times smaller than emission from our samples so it seems reasonable to neglect this band. For sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ we show PL with two maxima located at 1.83 and 1.86~eV, respectively. The PL signal of samples with QDs is shifted to smaller energies: the maxima are located at 1.78~eV for $S_\mathrm{with}$ and 1.74~eV for $S_\mathrm{cap}$. Finally, let us notice that the PL from $S_\mathrm{with}$ is twice stronger compared to other samples.

PL from our samples is compared with emission from GaP substrate multiplied by a factor of 70 (black).}

\subsection{Excitation intensity dependent PL}
\label{sec:intensity_PL_TU}
PL for each sample and excitation density $D$ was fitted by sum of three Gaussian curves and the individual bands corresponding to different optical transitions were studied.

%
Three emission bands of sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ labelled from smaller to greater energy $M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$, $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$, respectively, are related to electrons in the $X_{xy}$ (the $X$ bands for GaAs strained to GaP are split into $X_z$ and $X_{xy}$ where $z$ indicates growth direction, i.~e., the direction perpendicular to the layer) GaAs minima recombining with heavy holes in the $\Gamma$ band of GaAs layer. Ref.~\citep{Prieto_APL1997} discusses the effect of GaAs layer thickness on emission spectra where they observed overally an energy shift, with the thickness of the layer, but the energy separations between corresponding bands stayed nearly independent of layer thickness. Similarly as in Ref.~\citep{Prieto_APL1997}, where those were 12 and 32~meV, we detect similar ones and depending on the excitation density we have found them to be between 12--17~meV and 40--46~meV. Hence, the peaks cannot be attributed to thickness fluctuations, but instead they can be connected with phonon-assisted transitions. The energies of the phonons closely correspond to TA and LA phonon energies in GaP~\citep{Prieto_APL1997}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:12027_ref} PL of $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ is compared with studied set taken from Ref.~\citep{Prieto_APL1997}.



In Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_wo_int}~(a) we show PL spectra of the sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ with increasing $D$ and their deconvolution into individual band by Gaussian fits. The energy-shift is visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_wo_int}~(b), where PL peak energies as a function $D$ for individual bands are plotted and fitted with %usually used formula~\citep{Hatami_apl1995_intmodel,Glaser_apl1996_intmodel,Ledentsov_prb1995_intmodel} derived for spatially indirect optical transition in quantum wells (QWs) and QDs
%

\begin{equation}

where $E_\mathrm{I}$ is extrapolation energy to $D=0$~W/cm$^2$, $U_\mathrm{e}$ ($U_\mathrm{h}$) is Urbach energy tail for electrons (holes), and $\gamma$ is bend bending parameter, respectively.% constant which describes the gradient of the energy-shift. 
%The energy evolutions of the bands are well characterized with~Eq.~(\ref{eq:PL_intmodel}). The bands $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ are slightly shifted to blue with increasing $D$, these blue-shifts are described by almost identical $\gamma$, whereas $M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$ is rather independent on $D$ or slightly red-shifted.

The energy evolutions of the bands are well characterized with~Eq.~(\ref{eq:PL_intmodel}). The bands $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ are slightly shifted to blue with increasing $D$, whereas $M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$ is rather independent on $D$ or slightly red-shifted. Based on the values of parameters in the model~(\ref{eq:PL_intmodel}) we have determined the following types of band alignment: (i) $M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ are type-I without ($U_\mathrm{e}+U_\mathrm{h}$ is almost zero) or with blue-shift described only by Urbach energy tails ($U_\mathrm{e}+U_\mathrm{h}=1$~meV), (ii) whereas $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ has type-II band alignment with the same Urbach tails as $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ but for proper description of its blue-shift the parameter $\gamma$ is also necessary ($\gamma=3\pm2$~meVW$^{-1/3}$cm$^{2/3}$).


The oscillator strengths in Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_wo_int}(c) of $M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$, $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ follow a linear dependence in log-log graph with the excitation power ($\propto D^\beta$) in the whole measured range, indicating that there is neither saturation of electronic states nor the activation of the non-radiative events. The emission of $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ is linear only in the power density range 1 and 30~W/cm$^2$, for larger densities PL seems to be saturated.

	\label{fig:QD_w_int}
\end{figure}

Three Gaussian profiles ($M_0^\mathrm{w}$, $M_1^\mathrm{w}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w}$) in PL spectra were fitted and studied as a function of excitation density $D$ in the range between 0.04 and 125~W/cm$^2$, see Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_w_int}~(a). In Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_w_int}~(b) and~(c) we show the emission energy and oscillator strength of individual bands as a function of $D$, respectively. Analysis of the blue-shift of individual bands distinguishes type-II aligned for $M_0^\mathrm{w}$ transition and type-I for $M_1^\mathrm{w}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w}$. Interestingly, $M_1^\mathrm{w}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w}$ are proportional to $\ln(D)$ via same constant ($U_\mathrm{e}+U_\mathrm{h}=7$~meV) which leads us to speculate that these transitions originate from the same structure. 
%The energies of $M_0^\mathrm{w}$ and $M_1^\mathrm{w}$ are fitted by Eq.~\ref{eq:PL_intmodel}, but we can see the third root behaviour only in the beginning of the dependence, then the energies start to be saturated. The whole evolution of energy versus pumping power is much better characterized using the self-consistent multi-particle calculations as in Ref.~\citep{Klenovsky2017}.

The dependencies for oscillator strengths were fairly well fitted by the linear function in the whole range.

The evolution of the emission bands of sample $S_\mathrm{cap}$ with excitation intensity is compared with predictions obtained within the semi-self-consistent CI (SSCCI) presented in Ref.~\citep{Klenovsky2017} %and described in chapter~\ref{chap:SciRep} 
for 2.5~nm height In$_{0.15}$Ga$_{0.85}$As$_{0.85}$Sb$_{0.15}$/GaAs/GaP QD calculated by the supervisor. The band $M_1^\mathrm{c}$ is reasonably well reproduced by SSCCI with basis formed from single-particle wavefunctions calculated by $1\times8~\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ method with electrons originating from $L$ and holes form $\Gamma$-point. On the other hand, SSCCI with $8\times8~\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ basis for electrons coming from $\Gamma$-point might describe the band $M_2^\mathrm{c}$ reasonably well.

\subsection{Temperature dependent PL}
\label{Sec:temp_PL_TU}
PL spectra of the studied samples investigated as a function of temperature were fitted by three Gaussian profiles similarly as for the excitation density investigation in Sec.~\ref{sec:intensity_PL_TU}. The fitted energies were examined using the Varshni-like model
%
\begin{equation}
E(T)=E_0-\frac{\alpha T^2}{T+\Theta_\mathrm{D}}-\frac{\sigma^2}{k_\mathrm{B}T}, \label{eq:Varshni-like}
\end{equation}
where $E_0$ is the energy at temperature $T=0~\mathrm{K}$, $\alpha$ and $\Theta_\mathrm{D}$ are the Varshni parameters, $k_\mathrm{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. The model provides the thermally dependent correction of the empirical Varshni model~\citep{Varshni} describing temperature effects on the band gap of an idealized bulk semiconductor. The estimation proposed by Eliseev~\citep{Eliseev_apl2003_PLtemp} to evaluate the correction is used, which assumes the Gaussian-type distribution of energy of the localized states with broadening parameter $\sigma$.

The mechanisms responsible for the temperature quenching of PL intensity $I_\mathrm{PL}(T)$ can be accounted for by the Boltzmann model for excitonic recombination with two characteristic activation energies~\citep{Daly_prb1995, Alen_apl2011}
\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{PL}(T)=\frac{I_0}{1+\tau_0\left[\Gamma_1\exp(-E_1/k_\mathrm{B}T)+\Gamma_2\exp(-E_2/k_\mathrm{B}T)\right]},               \label{eq:Arhenius}
\end{equation}
where $I_0$ is the intensity at 15~K (lowest temperature reached in our measurements), $\tau_0$ temperature-independent radiative recombination time at 15~K, $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the activation energies of the two quenching mechanisms with related scattering rates $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$.%These parameters are representative of the average behaviour of the emissions bands, being the most important $\tau_0$, $E_1$ and $E_2$.

\subsubsection*{Sample without QDs $\mathbf{S_\mathrm{w/o}}$}

Three recognized emission bands ($M_0^\mathrm{w/o}$, $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$, and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$) in PL of sample ${S_\mathrm{w/o}}$ are individually investigated for temperatures from 15~K to 220~K, see Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_wo_temp}~(a).

The transition energies [Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_w_temp}~(b)] and the oscillator strengths [Fig.~\ref{fig:QD_w_temp}~(c)] are fitted by the Varshni model~Eq.~(\ref{eq:Varshni-like}) and the Boltzmann model~Eq.~(\ref{eq:Arhenius}), respectively, in the whole measured temperature range.

\subsubsection*{Discussion of temperature resolved PL results}
%
The value of $E_1$ (4--15~meV) corresponding to Eq.~(\ref{eq:Arhenius}) is comparable for all samples and also for every fitted PL band. This low activation energy is determining the low-temperature quenching of the PL and it is usually associated to carrier recombination through impurities~\cite{YuCardona}. The values of the high-temperature quenching $E_2$ (29--43~meV) are also similar across the samples except the deviation in $M_2^\mathrm{c}$ where we measured extremely small activation energy ($E_2=1$~meV) and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ with $E_2$ twice larger than for other bands ($E_2=62$~meV), see Fig.~\ref{fig:Arrhenius_all}. Finally, for a summary of identified parameters for our samples by models~(\ref{eq:Varshni-like}) and~(\ref{eq:Arhenius}) see Tabs.~\ref{tab:Varshni} and~\ref{tab:Arhenius}, respectively.

\subsection{Polarization dependent PL }
In our experiments, both the excitation beam and the detected PL radiation propagate perpendicularly to the sample surface and we analyze the latter by a rotating half-wave plate followed by a fixed linear polarizer. The angle between the crystallographic direction~[110] and the polarization vector is denoted $\theta$ in the following. Because low degrees of polarization of the emitted light are expected, we visualize our experimental results in terms of the degree of polarization
%
\begin{equation}
C(\theta)=\frac{I(\theta)-I_\mathrm{min}}{I_\mathrm{max}+I_\mathrm{min}},
\end{equation}
%
where $I_\mathrm{min}$ and $I_\mathrm{max}$ are extremal values of $I(\theta)$. Note, that for angle $\theta_\mathrm{max}$, such that $I(\theta_\mathrm{max})=I_\mathrm{max}$, the previous relation gives the maximum obtained degree of polarization $C(\theta_\mathrm{max})=C_\mathrm{max}$ (values in the polar graphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:PL_pol_all}).

It is reasonable to expect that the radiation emitted from sample ${S_\mathrm{with}}$ is not polarized, therefore, we are using the degree of polarization of $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ to re-calibrate degrees of polarizations for all other bands to eliminate the residual polarization of the whole setup. The calibrated $C(\theta)$ of individual bands are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:PL_pol_all}. Note that almost no polarization anisotropy is observed on sample ${S_\mathrm{w/o}}$.

The emission radiation of samples containing QDs is polarized along the [110]~crystallographic direction, in agreement with results on type-I InAs/GaAs QDs~\citep{HumPhysE} where the polarization anisotropy of $I(\theta)$ is dictated predominantly by the orientation of the wavefunction of hole states. Based on that and noticing the results of Ref.~\citep{Klenovsky2015} we conclude that the transitions in the studied samples are of type-I.

 %The sample ${S_\mathrm{with}}$ has $C_\mathrm{max}$ around 0.04, which is typically observable value on InAs/GaAs QDs, where one-particle wavefunctions are precisely located in the same position in the QD. Sb from GaSb capping on ${S_\mathrm{cap}}$ causes that the wavefunctions move slightly toward each other therefore the polarization anisotropy grows up to almost 0.15.
  The sample ${S_\mathrm{with}}$ has $C_\mathrm{max}$ around 0.04, which is comparable to that for InAs/GaAs QDs where one-particle wavefunctions are located approximately in the same position in QD. Antimony from GaSb capping in sample ${S_\mathrm{cap}}$ causes that the wavefunctions of electrons and holes are positioned slightly further apart from each other, therefore, the polarization anisotropy increases up to almost 0.15.

\section{Time-resolved photoluminiscence}
%The measurements can be fitted to a double exponential decay function after convolution with the instrument response function (IRF) shown in the same graph
We have studied the dynamics of the recombination processes of our QD samples as a function of the emission energy, excitation density, and temperature. Each measured TRPL signal of samples $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ and $S_\mathrm{with}$ has been deconvoluted using a double mono-exponential (2ME) decay model
%
\begin{equation}
I(t)=A_1\exp(-t/\tau_1)+A_2\exp(-t/\tau_2),
\end{equation}
 %
 characterized by the amplitude $A_1$ ($A_2$) and the decay time $\tau_1$ ($\tau_2$) for the slow (fast) decay process.
 To reproduce TRPL signal in a maximum of PL intensity of sample $S_\mathrm{cap}$ triple mono-exponential (3ME) decay model was used.
 In order to compare the samples we introduce characteristic PL decay time $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ as the weighted arithmetic mean of two (three) decay times for 2ME (3ME) model which corresponds to a decrease of PL intensity from its maximum value to the level of $1/\mathrm{e}$:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_\mathrm{PL}=\sum_{i=1}^{2 ( 3) } w_i\tau_i \label{eq:average_time}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where $w_i$ is weight [$w_i={A_i\cdot \tau_i }/{(\sum A_i \cdot \tau_i)}$] defined by fitting model.

Our analysis takes into account repumping of the slow component $\tau_1$ of the dynamics from previous pulses which leads to increase of \enquote{background} up to dark signal level as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all_max}.


\subsection{Emission energy dependent TRPL}
%

%Using previous analysis the similar fast component $\tau_2$ in range 5 and 13~ns for all samples and $\tau_3$ around 25~ns for $S_\mathrm{w}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ were found.

\end{figure}

% 3ME fits%
%
%In spite of similarity between our samples in $\tau_2$ of values in range 13 and 32~ns (for all samples) and $\tau_3$ smaller than 10~ns (only for $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$), $\tau_1$ of differs from 90~ns ($S_\mathrm{w/o}$) to 520~ns ($S_\mathrm{cap}$). To compare lifetimes across samples and emission energy where weights and number of mono-exponential decays varied, we use $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$. On the one hand, $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ enlarges within one sample of decreasing energy, see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all}(a) where $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ measured under the same conditions as a function of the emission energy for all three samples is summarized. On the second hand, that increases between samples from 74~ns ($S_\mathrm{w/o}$), over 164~ns ($S_\mathrm{with}$) to 364~ns ($S_\mathrm{cap}$). Decay times and appropriate weights of multi-exponential fits in the maximum of PL emission of each sample visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all_max} are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:TRPL_int_params}.

Although to reproduce TRPL signal of samples $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ and $S_\mathrm{with}$ we used 2ME and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ was fitted by 3ME model, respectively, our samples show similarity in $\tau_2$ which we find in the range from 13 to 23~ns, but the samples differ in $\tau_1$ which vary from 90~ns for $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ up to 520~ns for $S_\mathrm{cap}$. The third decay time in TRPL signal of $S_\mathrm{cap}$ is around 5~ns.

To compare lifetimes across samples and emission energies we use $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ incorporating varying weights and number of mono-exponential decays. On one hand, for each sample $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ increases with decreasing emission energy, see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all}~(a) where we summarize $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ measured under the same conditions as a function of the emission energy for all three samples. Interestingly, while $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ is changing similarly with energy for most of the samples, for emission of $S_\mathrm{cap}$ at 1.77~eV we have found much slower $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ (around 1~$\mu$s).

 On the second hand, $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ increases among samples: 74~ns ($S_\mathrm{w/o}$), 85~ns ($S_\mathrm{with}$), and 364~ns ($S_\mathrm{cap}$). Decay times and appropriate weights of multi-exponential fits in the maximum of PL emission of each sample visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all_max} are also listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:TRPL_int_params}.

\subsection{Excitation intensity dependent TRPL}
%
The excitation density of the pulse laser was varied in the range 0.08--0.7~W/cm$^2$, the optical response was in linear regime in the whole varied excitation range for each sample, see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_all}~(c). Thereafter, the measured TRPL signal has been deconvoluted by multi-exponential decay model. %, e.~g., Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_w} depicts TRPL signal in the maximum of PL spectra of $S_\mathrm{with}$). 

Let us start with TRPL of sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ where $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ in the emission energy range from 1.80 to 1.86~eV is constant at 80~ns which leads us to substitute the dynamical processes for this energy interval by investigation of decay times in the maximum of PL intensity, see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_wo}. We observe a decrease of decay times for $\tau_1$ from 130 to 90~ns and for $\tau_2$ from 30 to 13~ns, respectively.

The decrease of decay times point to indirect transition of electrons from X band to heavy holes in $\Gamma$ band of GaAs, moreover, weight of the processes stays the same irrespective of pumping which is probably connected with character of $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ transitions. As previously discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec:PL_int_wo} we conclude that $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$ is a phonon replica of $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$. The decay times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ correspond to bands $M_2^\mathrm{w/o}$ and $M_1^\mathrm{w/o}$, respectively. The previous assignment will be discussed in Sec.~\ref{chap:TRPL_temp}.
%We refer to temperature resolved TRPL in Sec.~\ref{chap:TRPL_temp} where the nature of $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ will be discussed. %tau1 je bezfonon, tau2 je fonononova

%This behaviour arrived us to Because the faster process $\tau_2$ was observed across our samples and emission energy, we assume that it comes from the substrate. (Je to dobre s tim typem II v rec. prostoru?)

%We observe a decrease of the fast decay component with increasing excitation density as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_w}(b)--(c), which is in agreement with behaviour of type-II nanostructures observed elsewhere~\citep{Ledentsov_prb1995_intmodel,Gu_prb2005_TRPLtype2,Manna_apl2012_TRPLtype2,Zaitsev_prb2007}. At higher excitation intensity, a larger carrier concentration of the photogenerated electron-hole pairs results in band bending, hence a stronger overlap of electron-hole wave-functions, and thus a faster decay.

%Samples $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ were fitted by 3ME model with very similar behaviour of $\tau_2$ as in sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$, i.~e., a slight decrease in decay times and the same difference in weights. Moreover, $\tau_2$ is in range between 20 and 35~ns which is comparable with $\tau_2$ in $S_\mathrm{w/o}$. But, interestingly, $\tau_1$ is independent on excitation intensity or slightly increasing with that for both $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ samples and it is much longer than other decay times: $\tau_1$ is between 330~ns (450~ns) and 380~ns (540~ns) for $S_\mathrm{with}$ ($S_\mathrm{cap}$). 



Sample $S_\mathrm{with}$ was deconvoluted by 2ME and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ by 3ME model see panels (a) in Figs.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_w}--\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c}. Similar decrease in decay times from 28 to 20~ns as for sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ is observed. This process has been previously discussed also for $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ and it is connected with radiative emission from GaAs layer.
%

Because time response of the emission from $S_\mathrm{with}$ characterized by $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ in the spectral range from 1.77 to 1.82~eV is similar, we again describe the dynamics of $S_\mathrm{with}$ for energies in the maximum of PL intensity. The slower process labelled as $\tau_1$ decreases with excitation power.

On the other hand, $\tau_\mathrm{PL}$ of sample $S_\mathrm{cap}$ is slower for the high energy side of PL spectrum (energy around 1.77~eV) than for lower energies of PL and also compared to other samples. For this reason we investigated both energy intervals individually. Analysis in {Figs.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c}--\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c_L}} by 3ME model shows that in both there are two comparable processes $\tau_2$ and $\tau_3$ present. While for increasing excitation power $\tau_2$ decreases and it is most probably associated with the dynamics of GaAs layer, $\tau_3$ stays almost constant at 5~ns and presents with type-I nature of the confinement~\cite{Heitz_TRPL_typeI_PRB97}. We attribute the latter to transitions between electrons from $\Gamma$ band to holes from the same band, see also Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c_theory}.%{\color{red}{(m√°≈° nƒõjakou referenci, ja nemuzu nic najit)}}{\color{green}{(zkus treba: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pssc.200881512 https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2964191 a samozrejme nas stary znamy, ktery prijede pristi tyden: https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.56.10435 )}}





%The processes characterized by $\tau_1$ and $\tau_3$ are presented only on samples $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$, as can be seen in panels (b) in Figs.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_w}--\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c}, stay almost constant ($\tau_3=8$~ns) or only slightly increase ($\tau_1$) with increasing excitation power which is behaviour observed for type-I nanostructures. (m√°≈° nƒõjakou referenci, ja nemuzu nic najit)


%Process characterized by $\tau_3$ is presented only on samples $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ and stays constant with increasing excitation power at 8~ns.

Interestingly, time $\tau_1$ corresponding to the third process is increasing with excitation intensity for both low and high part of PL of $S_\mathrm{cap}$ and it is also much longer than other decay times: $\tau_1$ is between 330~ns (650~ns) and 380~ns (2.8~$\mu$s) at 1.75~eV (1.77~eV). Note, however, that the weight of processes characterized by decay time $\tau_1$ for both $S_\mathrm{with}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ decreases with increasing excitation.


Finally, processes characterized by decay times $\tau_1$ and $\tau_3$ and their evolutions with intensity of excitation laser were compared to theoretical predictions obtained by SSCCI method by the supervisor. The process associated with $\tau_1$ was identified as a radiative transition between electrons originating from $L$ and holes from $\Gamma$-point of the reciprocal space. On the other hand, a radiative transition from $\Gamma$ electrons can describe the process characterized by $\tau_3$. For comparison of SSCCI calculations and experimentally obtained decay times as a function of excitation power see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_int_c_theory}.

\subsection{Temperature dependent TRPL}
\label{chap:TRPL_temp}
%
TRPL variations with temperature are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_wo}-\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_c} and are deconvoluted again by 2ME model for $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ and $S_\mathrm{with}$ and 3ME model for $S_\mathrm{cap}$, respectively. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_w}~(b) the resulting decay time $\tau_2$ of sample $S_\mathrm{with}$ increases up to the temperature of 30~K and thereafter progressively reduce which is characteristic of the appearance of thermally activated escape paths~\citep{Manna_apl2012_TRPLtype2}. Contrary to $\tau_2$ on sample $S_\mathrm{with}$, on $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ and $S_\mathrm{cap}$ the reduction of the decay times begins already at lowest temperatures without an increase at the beginning.

Similarly as in power series, the weight of the slower component contribution $\tau_1$ becomes smaller with increasing temperature.

If we assume similarly as in Ref.~\citep{t_alvarez} that at 15~K the only loss mechanism is radiative recombination, then the radiative $\tau_\mathrm{R}$ and non-radiative $\tau_\mathrm{NR}$ decay times can be extracted from the slow decay time $\tau_1$ by
%
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{R}=\frac{I_0}{I_\mathrm{PL}(T)}\tau_1 \label{eq:tau_R_fromtau1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\tau_1}=\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{R}} + \frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{NR}}

\noindent where $I_0$ and $I_\mathrm{PL}$ are the PL intensity at 15~K and that as a function of $T$, respectively. As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_decon}, $\tau_\mathrm{NR}$ decreases with temperature as is usually the case for thermally activated processes. Thereafter, we fit the reduction of the parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NR}$ with temperature by the following model involving two non-radiative processes 
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{NR}}=\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{NR}^1}\exp{\left(\frac{-E_1}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)} + \frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{NR}^2}\exp{\left(\frac{-E_2}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)} \label{eq:nonradiative}
\end{equation}
characterized by activation energies $E_1$ and $E_2$ and time constants $\tau_\mathrm{NR}^1$ and $\tau_\mathrm{NR}^2$, respectively.
Conversely, $\tau_\mathrm{R}$ increases exponentially with temperature
%
\begin{equation}
\tau_\mathrm{R} = \tau_\mathrm{R}^0 + \tau_\mathrm{R}^T \exp{\left(\frac{T}{T_C}\right)}, \label{eq:tau_R} 
\end{equation}
where $ \tau_\mathrm{R}^0$ ($ \tau_\mathrm{R}^T$) describes the temperature independent (dependent) part of the radiative decay and $T_C$ is the characteristic temperature corresponding to the energy of localized states. 

The behavior of the decay time of the fast component $\tau_2$ with temperature, on the other hand, suggests that there is a non-radiative contribution even at lowest temperatures which prevents using Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_R_fromtau1}) directly. To overcome this limitation, we assume that the radiative lifetime at 15~K is the same that for the slow component $\tau_1$, $\tau_2^\mathrm{R}(15K)=\tau_1^\mathrm{R}(15K)$, and a temperature independent, non-radiative decay $\tau_\mathrm{C}$ is also present and that is given by
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{C}}=\frac{1}{\tau_2(15K)}-\frac{1}{\tau_2^\mathrm{R}(15K)}.\label{eq:tau_C}
\end{eqnarray}

Since $\tau_\mathrm{C}$ is temperature independent, we can now calculate the radiative lifetime $\tau_2^\mathrm{R}$ of the fast component at any temperature using Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_R_fromtau1}) by replacing $\tau_1$ with $\tau_2$ and $1/\tau_\mathrm{NR}$ with $1/\tau_\mathrm{C}+1/\tau_2^\mathrm{NR}$. The overall decay time as a function of temperature will be given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{\tau_2(T)}=\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{C}}+\frac{1}{\tau_2^\mathrm{R}(T)}+\frac{1}{\tau_2^\mathrm{NR}(T)}.
\end{eqnarray}
%
Now we can repeat the analysis of the radiative and non-radiative part described by Eqs.~(\ref{eq:tau_R})--(\ref{eq:nonradiative}) for $\tau_2^\mathrm{R}$ and $\tau_2^\mathrm{NR}$.

In the case of sample $S_\mathrm{cap}$ where three exponential decays are presented, we repeat the assumption described above for $\tau_3$ where we assumed the same radiative lifetime of $\tau_3$ as for $\tau_2$, $\tau_3^\mathrm{R}(15K)=\tau_2^\mathrm{R}(15K)$, and temperature independent non-radiative lifetime $\tau_\mathrm{C}$ similarly to Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_C}) as $1 / \tau_\mathrm{C} = 1/ \tau_3(15K)-1/ \tau_3^\mathrm{R}(15K)$.

%KONEC PK
Combining Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_R_fromtau1}) to Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_R}) and repetition that for all decay times we can obtain an Arrhenius-like equation with an explicit dependence of the PL intensity on all the parameters derived from the TRPL analysis
%
\begin{equation}
I_\mathrm{PL}(T)=I_0\sum_{i=1}^{2(3)}\frac{1}{1+\left[\tau_{i\mathrm{R}}^0+\tau_{i\mathrm{R}}^T\exp{\left(\frac{T}{T_{i\mathrm{C}}}\right)}\right] \times \left[\frac{1}{\tau_{i\mathrm{NR}}^1}\exp{\left(\frac{-E_{i1}}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)} + \frac{1}{\tau_{i\mathrm{NR}}^2}\exp{\left(\frac{-E_{i2}}{k_\mathrm{B}T}\right)}\right]}, \label{eq:TRPL_Arhenius}
\end{equation}
%
where the upper limit of sum up depends on a number of mono-exponential decays in fitting model used for deconvolution of TRPL signal.

The radiative and non-radiative component are fitted by Eq.~(\ref{eq:tau_R}) and Eq.~(\ref{eq:nonradiative}), respectively.}
	\label{fig:TRPL_temp_decon}
\end{figure}

As it can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:Arrhenius_PLandTRPL}, this formula is equally good in reproducing experimental data as~Eq.~(\ref{eq:Arhenius}). 


\newpage

We now discuss the numerical results received in this analysis for individual decay times obtained from TRPL signal at maximum of PL intensity of each studied samples. The results are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:TRPL_params}. 

As can be seen in panels~(a$_1$) of Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_decon} the radiative decay time of slow component $\tau_1$ of sample $S_\mathrm{w/o}$ does not depend on temperature, whereas radiative contribution of $\tau_2$ [panel (a$_2$)] enlarges exponentially with temperature from 0~ps at 0~K. This behaviour point to, that $\tau_2$ decay time is associated with phonon replica where in 0~K phonons are not available for assisted transition. With temperature amount of phonons increase resulting in increasing relevance of $\tau_2$ with temperature, see Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_wo}~(c). To discuss non-radiative contribution, in both decay times we identified shallow impurities~\citep{Cardona} with localization energy $E_1$ around 16~meV and characteristic non-radiative constant $\tau^1_\mathrm{NR}$ of 235~ps. Activation energy $E_2=442-445$~meV of the second non-radiative process $\tau^2_\mathrm{NR}=20$~ps corresponds to unipolar scape of heavy holes from GaAs layer to GaP matrix. The obtained value of $E_2$ is in agreement with escape energy of {\color{green}{VALUE je≈°tƒõ jednou zmƒõ≈ôit v pythonu unikovou energii HH pro 5ML vrstvu}} determined from 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations.

Looking to binding energy ($E=4-46$~meV) it seems that non-radiative losses of dynamical processes in $S_\mathrm{with}$ are caused by shallow traps. Contrary to radiative contribution in $S_\mathrm{w/o}$, we show in panels~(b$_1$)~and~(b$_2$) of Fig.~\ref{fig:TRPL_temp_decon} increasing of radiative part of both slow $\tau_1$ and as well as fast $\tau_2$ processes. The slower process starts at $\tau_\mathrm{R}^0=360$~ns and exponentially increasing proportional to $\tau_\mathrm{R}^T=26.68$~ns, whereas the faster process starts at 20.4~ns and is proportional to $\tau_\mathrm{R}^T=6.58$~ns. Energies of localized states of these two radiative times for $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ characterized by $T_\mathrm{C}$ are 31.7~K and 44.1~K, respectively.

In case of $S_\mathrm{cap}$ we can shown in panels~(c$_1$)--(c$_3$) similar behavior of radiative times of individual dynamics processes as in $S_\mathrm{with}$. Regardless different $\tau_\mathrm{R}^0=230.8$~ns and $\tau_\mathrm{R}^0=456$~ps at 0~K and dissimilar $\tau_\mathrm{R}^T=89.56$~ns and $\tau_\mathrm{R}^T=1.97$~ns for $\tau_1$ and $\tau_3$ processes, respectively, we found comparable values of $T_\mathrm{C}$ for that which lead us to an opinion that these processes come from same structure. This ascertainment is in agreement with the result from SSCCI calculations presented in the previous section, where $\tau_1$ was identified as transition between electrons from $L$ and holes from $\Gamma$-point and $\tau_3$ as transition from $\Gamma$ electrons. From analysis of non-radiative times we found escape localization energy of electrons from $\Gamma$-point of $E_2=557.5$~meV which is comparable to $400$~meV calculated by 8-band $\mathbf{k \cdot p}$ method. Other non-radiative processes are in the range of localization energies of shallow traps.

%The non-radiative process with smaller activation energy ($E_1$ between 6 and 18~meV) is probably associated with trapping of carriers by impurities or defects in the vicinity of QDs, as it has been also before for InAs/InP quantum wires~\citep{Alen_apl2011}. The other process is characterized by faster time constant $\tau_\mathrm{NR}^2$ ($\tau_\mathrm{NR}^1/\tau_\mathrm{NR}^2>5$) is close to the thermally activated capture of excitions by nonradiative defects in GaAs layer~\citep{Seravallo_apl2005,Kohki_apl1997}. 

The values obtained by fitting the dependencies by model in Eq.~(\ref{eq:TRPL_Arhenius}) are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:TRPL_params} and are comparable with parameters gained from the temperature dependence PL data shown in Sec.~\ref{Sec:temp_PL_TU}, which are equally well reproduced by Eq.~\ref{eq:Arhenius}, see the parameters resume in Tab.~\ref{tab:Arhenius}.

The previous temperature dependent TRPL and PL analysis of the samples allow us to draw simple scheme of the time evolution of the levels involved in the exciton dynamics, namely that of the recombining level \textbf{F} and three trap levels \textbf{N$_i$}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Arrhenius_PLandTRPL}.

\section{Conclusions}
We have experimentally studied the electronic structure of set (without QDs, with QDs, with QDs and GaSb capping) of In$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$/GaP QDs with 5~ML GaAs interlayer grown by MOVPE. We have pointed by TEM and EDX measurements to a high amount of Ga and As in our samples which lead to type-I band alignment. Furthermore, we have shown that the samples emitted around 1.8~eV with anisotropy elongated along [110]~crystallographic direction.   % For our analysis set of sample (without QDs, with QDs, with QDs and GaSb capping) were grown by MOVPE.
