\chapter{More information from TEM and EDX experiments}
\label{chapter:appendix_TEM}
We measured TEM together with EDX to get information on the chemical composition of sample S$_\mathrm{cap}$. The results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TEM_app} confirm the constituents given in Fig.~\ref{fig:TUstructure}.

The emission EDX spectrum (Fig.~\ref{fig:EDX}) shows all elements present in S$_\mathrm{cap}$ sample, i.~e., Ga, P, In, As, Sb, Al; oxygen is detected due to degradation of the sample by oxidation processes; Co, Fe and Zr are typical compounds used in TEM objectives. In Fig.~\ref{fig:concentration_appendix} the distribution of the concentration in the vertical cut is shown, Al$_{0.4}$GaP layer and QD areas are located between 250 and 280$\,$nm and around 80$\,$nm, respectively.
