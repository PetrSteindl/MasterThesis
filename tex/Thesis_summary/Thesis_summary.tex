In this thesis we presented the results of theoretical and experimental characterization of the influence of the chemical composition of semiconductor quantum dots on their electronic structure. Three QDs systems were studied, (i) InGaAs QDs, (ii) InAs QDs capped GaAsSb layer, and (iii) In$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$ on GaP substrate covered by 5~ML GaAs. The theoretical study was performed using 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ method and was supported by configuration interaction method provided by the supervisor. The experimental part was performed mainly by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Information about size, shape and material contribution of QDs was collected during TEM and EDX experiments.
