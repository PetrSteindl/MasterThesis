In this thesis, we presented the results of the theoretical and experimental characterization of the influence of the chemical composition of semiconductor quantum dots on their electronic structure. Three QDs systems were studied, (i) InGaAs QDs, (ii) InAs QDs capped GaAsSb layer, and (iii) In$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$ on GaP substrate covered by 5~ML GaAs. The theoretical study was performed using 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ method and was supported by configuration interaction method provided by the supervisor. The experimental part was performed mainly by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Information about size, shape and material contribution of QDs was collected during TEM and EDX experiments.

We pinpointed the importance of non-linear piezoelectricity to electric dipole moment in InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots and showed that non-linear terms might be more dominant compared to linear one. Moreover, we presented the necessity of a large built-in in-plane stress created due to bonding the sample onto the piezo actuator. During $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations was found that the most important parameters for influence electric dipole in QD are height of dot and the bonding pre-stress. For these quantities were created analytical models originated from empirical observation which can be used for estimation of the electric dipole in quantum dots.

We have experimentally by intensity and polarization resolved photoluminescence studied the excitonic structure of type-II InAs/GaAsSb/GaAs quantum dots. In our spectra we identified multiparticle optical transitions of neutral exciton, biexciton, and negative trion. Different polarization enables us to discriminate spatially different recombination channels and revealed the coexistence of type-I and type-II confinement.

Moreover, blue-shift of type-II transitions in InAs/GaAsSb/GaAs have been analyzed. For the determined complexes multi-exponential shift of emission energy with increasing excitation power was observed and modelled by self-consistent multi-particle calculations with added background potential in quantum dot area. This approximate method can successfully explain (i) blue-shift of uncapped QDs which is well explained by relation $E\propto P^{1/3}$, and (ii) blue-shift capped QDs.

Furthermore, $\Gamma$ and $L$ bands in In$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$/5~ML GaAs/GaP QDs around $x=0.9$ and $y=0.85$ swap which was observed in our photoluminescence measurements. These structures have significantly high blue-shift of the emission spectrum (more than 30~meV in 4 magnitudes of excitation power) although have type-I (in direct space) alignment. Obtained optical transitions differ in radiative time component which for $\Gamma$-band originated recombination was determined around 25~ns. The indirect (in reciprocal-space) transition from $L$ band is slower and much more sensitive to material content - for $x=0.75$ and $y=0.95$ is around 200~ns, for $x=0.85$ and $y=0.85$ is around 300~ns.
