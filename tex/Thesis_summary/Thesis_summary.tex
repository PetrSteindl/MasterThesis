In this thesis we presented the results of theoretical and experimental characterization of the influence of the chemical composition of semiconductor quantum dots on their electronic structure. Three QDs systems were studied, (i) InGaAs QDs, (ii) InAs QDs capped GaAsSb layer, and (iii) In$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$ on GaP substrate covered by 5~ML GaAs.
