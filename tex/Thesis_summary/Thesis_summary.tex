In this thesis, we presented the results of the theoretical and experimental characterization of the influence of the chemical composition of semiconductor quantum dots on their electronic structure. Three QDs systems were studied, (i) InGaAs QDs, (ii) InAs QDs capped GaAsSb layer, and (iii) In$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$As$_y$Sb$_{1-y}$ on GaP substrate covered by 5~ML GaAs. The theoretical study was performed using 8-band $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ method and was supported by configuration interaction method provided by the supervisor. The experimental part was performed mainly by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. Information about size, shape and material contribution of QDs was collected during TEM and EDX experiments.

We pinpointed the importance of non-linear piezoelectricity to electric dipole moment in InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots and showed that non-linear terms might be more dominant compared to linear one. Moreover, we presented the necessity of a large built-in in-plane stress created due to bonding the sample onto the piezo actuator. During $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ calculations was found that the most important parameters for influence electric dipole in QD are height of dot and the bonding pre-stress. For these quantities were created analytical models originated from empirical observation which can be used for estimation of the electric dipole in quantum dots.
